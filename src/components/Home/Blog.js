Authentication is the process of identifying users and validating who they claim to be. One of the most common and obvious factors to authenticate identity is a password. If the user name matches the password credential, it means the identity is valid, and the system grants access to the user.
In authentication process, the identity of users are checked for providing the access to the system.
In authentication process, users or persons are verified.
t is done before the authorization process.
Authentication determines whether the person is user or not.
What is Authorization
Authorization happens after a user’s identity has been successfully authenticated. It is about offering full or partial access rights to resources like database, funds, and other critical information to get the job done.
While in authorization process, person’s or user’s authorities are checked for accessing the resources.
While in this process, users or persons are validated.
While it needs user’s privilege or security levels.
hile it determines What permission do user have? 
need some sort of access control. And Firebase databases will notify you if you don’t have a minimum of access control. The minimum access control in Firebase world it will the database rules. If you don’t use access control, you will let the door open for users getting access to foreign data. For many applications the minimum level will be enough. And you don’t need roles and different level of access every time.

But if you have different use cases for the users, or different levels made for them, it will be necessary for you to handle the authorization. The rules of the database will help you a little, but you have to enhance the identity platform.

You could use a third party user and role database, and connect it with Firebase. Or you could use Firebase and define a collection of users and also combine it with the new custom claims and make a cloud function that will be the glue for the whole system.
using the phone number verification provided by Firebase. It is an easy way to let your users access your app without using a social media third party login. However, Firebase inform you, that if you only use phone verification and a one time password (OTP), it will not be considered safe, compared to other solutions that use multi factor authentication.

              What other options do you have to implement authentication?

Firebase Authentication is a powerful and reasonably easy to use tool that gives you(r app) the ability to authenticate your users using their preferred auth mechanism (rather than your proprietary system requiring your users to remember passwords for myriad sites).

If your users already have a Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Apple etc. account, enabling the relevant subset from these "additional providers" adds very little overhead to your code but increases the chances your users will already have an account that they can use.

In addition, because e.g. Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Apple is handling authentication for you, your app becomes simpler and, unless you choose the native providers (phone, email) (which you should probably not do) you don't have to take on the burden in being diligent in managing your users' credential (e.g. email, passwords etc).

Usually, authentication by a server entails the use of a user name and password. Other ways to authenticate can be through cards, retina scans, voice recognition, and fingerprints.

Firebase is originally developed by Firebase inc and later acquired by Google. It provides different kinds of services that help you to develop high-quality mobile and web applications to grow your business. It is compatible with Web, iOS, Android, and OS X clients. With Firebase, developers don’t need to worry about the backend programming, Authentication, API development, database (real-time cloud-hosted NoSQL database and cloud firestore), File storage, etc. Firebase provides all the services with very efficient and fast performance.

Firebase is a full package that can help in developing your mobile or web applications faster with fewer resources and more efficiency. Now, let’s look at some of the services and use of it.

There are many services which Firebase provides, Most useful of them are:

Cloud Firestore
Cloud Functions
Authentication
Hosting
Cloud Storage
Google Analytics
Predictions
Cloud Messaging
Dynamic Links
Remote Config

This article purely focuses on how firebase services can make the mobile application development process easier.
We know that the widely used services for this purpose are Cloud Messaging, Authentication, Dynamic Links, Predictions, Google Analytics, and Remote Config. Let’s discuss these services in detail.
